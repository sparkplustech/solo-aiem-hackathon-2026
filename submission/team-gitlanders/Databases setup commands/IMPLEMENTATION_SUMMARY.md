# ✅ Implementation Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. ✅ Upvote System (Fixed & Ready)

**What was wrong:**
- The code for upvotes existed but database tables were missing
- `post_upvotes` table didn't exist
- `increment_post_upvotes()` and `decrement_post_upvotes()` functions were missing

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ Complete database schema in `DATABASE_COMPLETE_SETUP.sql`
- ✅ Upvote increment/decrement RPC functions
- ✅ Proper upvote counting logic
- ✅ Each user can only upvote once per post
- ✅ Upvote counts refresh automatically

**How it works:**
```typescript
// User clicks upvote button
handleUpvote(postId) {
  if (hasUpvoted) {
    // Remove: delete from post_upvotes + call decrement RPC
    await supabase.from('post_upvotes').delete()
    await supabase.rpc('decrement_post_upvotes', { post_id })
  } else {
    // Add: insert to post_upvotes + call increment RPC
    await supabase.from('post_upvotes').insert()
    await supabase.rpc('increment_post_upvotes', { post_id })
  }
  fetchPosts() // Refresh to show new count
}
```

**Files modified:**
- ✅ `DATABASE_COMPLETE_SETUP.sql` - Complete schema
- ✅ `src/components/CommunityFeed.tsx` - Already had the logic

---

### 2. ✅ Profile Picture Upload (Fully Implemented)

**What was missing:**
- No database column for storing avatar URL
- No storage bucket for images
- No upload functionality

**What's implemented:**
- ✅ `profiles.avatar_url` column to store image URL
- ✅ `avatars` storage bucket with proper RLS policies
- ✅ File upload with validation (max 2MB, images only)
- ✅ Automatic old avatar deletion when uploading new one
- ✅ Loading spinner during upload
- ✅ Immediate display of uploaded picture

**How it works:**
```typescript
// User selects image via camera button
handleAvatarUpload(file) {
  // Validate size and type
  if (file.size > 2MB) return error
  if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) return error
  
  // Delete old avatar if exists
  await supabase.storage.from('avatars').remove(oldPath)
  
  // Upload new avatar
  const path = `${userId}/avatar-${timestamp}.${ext}`
  await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(path, file)
  
  // Get public URL
  const { publicUrl } = supabase.storage.from('avatars').getPublicUrl(path)
  
  // Save to profile
  await supabase.from('profiles').update({ avatar_url: publicUrl })
  
  // Update UI immediately
  setProfileData({ ...profileData, avatarUrl: publicUrl })
}
```

**Files modified:**
- ✅ `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` - Full upload functionality
- ✅ `DATABASE_COMPLETE_SETUP.sql` - Storage bucket + RLS policies

**Features:**
- ✅ Click "Edit Profile" → Camera icon appears
- ✅ Select image from device
- ✅ Upload with progress indicator
- ✅ Image displays immediately after upload
- ✅ Falls back to initials if no avatar
